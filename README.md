# Text Based Web Browser
The ‘Text-Based Web Browser’ is a software application that displays only the text of an HTML file, ignoring the graphical content. It  doesn't render images, videos, music or games. The browser works only on local files (not on remote Web pages) and allows the user to open and navigate through HTML files using links. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was used.

The user is able to open an HTML file in two ways: 
1) Entering the specific addresses of the file in the address bar.
2) by choosing the HTML file via a file chooser. A graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented allowing the user to interact with the browser.

In addition to hyperlinks, the following HTML tags are handled:
  ```html
<A>, <UL>, <OL>, <HR>,<BR> and <P>.
```
